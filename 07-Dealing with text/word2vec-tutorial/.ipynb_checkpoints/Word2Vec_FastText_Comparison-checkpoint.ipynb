In case char n-gram embeddings are not present, this reduces (at least theoretically) to the original word2vec model.

Our hypothesis that the char n-grams result in better performance on syntactic analogies seems fair. It also seems possible that char n-grams hurt semantic accuracy a little.

    "4. The semantic accuracy for all models increases significantly with the increase in corpus size.\n",
    "5. However, the increase in syntactic accuracy from the increase in corpus size for the n-gram FastText model is lower (in both relative and absolute terms). This could possibly indicate that advantages gained by incorporating morphological information could be less significant in case of larger corpus sizes (the corpuses used in the original paper seem to indicate this too)\n",
    "6. Training times for gensim are slightly lower than the fastText no-ngram model, and significantly lower than the n-gram variant. This is quite impressive considering fastText is implemented in C++ and Gensim in Python (with calls to low-level BLAS routines for much of the heavy lifting). You could read [this post](http://rare-technologies.com/word2vec-in-python-part-two-optimizing/) for more details regarding word2vec optimisation in Gensim. Note that these times include importing any dependencies and serializing the models to disk, and not just the training times."

    "These preliminary results seem to indicate fastText embeddings are significantly better than word2vec at encoding syntactic information. This is expected, since most syntactic analogies are morphology based, and the char n-gram approach of fastText takes such information into account. The original word2vec model seems to perform better on semantic tasks, since words in semantic analogies are unrelated to their char n-grams, and the added information from irrelevant char n-grams worsens the embeddings. It'd be interesting to see how transferable these embeddings are for different kinds of tasks by comparing their performance in a downstream supervised task."
